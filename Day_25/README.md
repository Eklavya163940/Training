# Comprehensive AWS S3 Management and Static Website Hosting

## Objective

This project is designed to test and enhance your knowledge and skills in managing AWS S3 storage classes, lifecycle management, bucket policies, access control lists (ACLs), and hosting a static website on S3. The goal is to ensure that you have mastered the critical aspects of AWS S3 through practical application.

## Project Scenario

You are tasked with creating and managing an S3 bucket for a fictional company, **TechVista Inc.**, which hosts a static website to display their product portfolio.
